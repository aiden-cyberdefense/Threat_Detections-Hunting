This project aims to list browser extensions that are often targeted by stealers or used maliciously by attackers.

You will find a list of extension IDs and their respective names and links for reference.

If you know of any additional sensitive browser extensions that should be included in this list, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

todo:
  - add a Hunting Guide for detecting potential stealers or even installation of sensitives/malicious extensions (https://mthcht.medium.com/detecting-browser-extensions-installations-e0ac2b45c46b)
  - test cursedbrowser + ElSicarius/chunkloader
