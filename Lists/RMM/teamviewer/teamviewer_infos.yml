          This log records incoming connections to the TeamViewer client. After the progam is removed this log file will persist untill a reboot. Fields and their values are:
          - **Client ID**: Numeric identifier of the remote machine (e.g., 1025538549).
          - **Client Hostname**: Hostname of the remote machine (e.g., mechant_host).
          - **Start Date**: Date when the connection started (DD-MM-YYYY format, e.g., 22-08-2022).
          - **Start Time**: Time when the connection started (HH:MM:SS format, e.g., 14:50:52).
          - **End Date**: Date when the connection ended (DD-MM-YYYY format, e.g., 22-08-2022).
          - **End Time**: Time when the connection ended (HH:MM:SS format, e.g., 14:51:09).
          - **Local User**: Username on the local machine (e.g., lab).
          - **Connection Type**: Type of connection (e.g., RemoteControl).
          - **Session ID**: Unique identifier for the session (e.g., {5a0ba592-76be-48de-8015-2365251d6520}).

          This log provides detailed session information, including:
          - **Date and Time**: Timestamp of the log entry (e.g., 2024/01/02 15:00:00.000).
          - **Log Level**: Severity of the log entry (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR).
          - **Message**: Details about session initiation, data transfer activities, and errors/warnings.
          - Failed Connection Attempts: Search for “Trying connection to <Destination TeamViewer ID>” to find attempts.
          - Public IP Address Identification: Search for “punch received” to find external IP addresses from connections.
          - Successful Session Identification: Search for “New Participant added in CParticipantManager” to identify session details.
          - Source TeamViewer ID: Search for “Login::Identify” to find the source PC’s TeamViewer ID.

          - targetID: Target’s TeamViewer ID.
          - action: Connection type (e.g., RemoteSupport).
        - File names can be changed; TeamViewer uses targetID for the dropdown list in the GUI.
        **Example of a tvc file content**:
        ```
        [TeamViewer Configuration]
        targetID=192.168.1.3
